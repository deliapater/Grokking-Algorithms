# Problem Statement

### 4.1 Write out the code for the earlier `sum` function.

### 4.2 Write a recursive function to count the number of items in a list.

### 4.3 Find the maximum number in a list.

### 4.4 Remember binary search from chapter 1? It's a divide-and-conquer algorithm, too. Can you come up with the base case and recursive case for binary search?

`The base case for binary search is an array with one item. If the item you're looking for matches the item in the array, you found it! Otherwise, it isn't in the array`
