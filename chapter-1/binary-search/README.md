# Problem Statement

## 1.1 Suppose you have a sorted list of 128 names, and you are searching through it using binary search. What's the maximum number you would search?

`` Maximum number of steps = Log2(n)``
`` Log2(128) = 7 ``

## 1.2 Suppose you double the size of the list. What's the maximum number of steps now?

`` Maximum number of steps = Log2(n) ``
`` Log2(256) = 8 ``
